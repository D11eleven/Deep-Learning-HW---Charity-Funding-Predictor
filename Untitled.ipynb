    "### Step 4: Write a Report on the Neural Network Model\n",
    "\n",
    "For this part of the Challenge, youâ€™ll write a report on the performance of the deep learning model you created for AlphabetSoup.\n",
    "\n",
    "The report should contain the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Overview** of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Results**: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Data Preprocessing\n",
    "    * What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?\n",
    "    * What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?\n",
    "    * What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?\n",
    "  * Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model\n",
    "    * How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?\n",
    "    * Were you able to achieve the target model performance?\n",
    "    * What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Summary**: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.\n"
